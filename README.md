Inspired by the Skaven from Warhammer Fantasy, Warpstone is a mod about eating strange gems to mutate yourself in strange and powerful ways. It adds Warpstone as an ore and after crushing it up and "eating" the resulting dust you will begin to mutate. The more you eat the more you mutate and the more unstable you become. The higher your instability the more mutations will occur, both good and bad, but will also grant you Corruption.

Your Corruption grows with your degree of Instability, becoming more corrupt will make your mutations stronger and allow you to develop some of 44 unique mutations. All of this you can see easily through a button on the inventory screen.

This does not come without risk, consuming Warpstone has a risk of causing you to wither away and die. If you die, you lose all mutations and instability, the only element that survives death is your Corruption. Grow corrupt with the unholy power of Warpstone Gems and gamble with your life in a cyclical quest for unlimited power.
